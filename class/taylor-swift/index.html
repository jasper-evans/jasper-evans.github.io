        <h1>Taylor Swift:<br> The Master of the Product Launch</h1>

            <p>From the intentionality of each lyric and note, to the precision with which she applies her red
            lipstick, Taylor Swift leaves no details to chance.</p>

            <p>Ms. Swift made an indelible mark on the global stage as a singer-songwriter with extraordinary talent and has built a business on her own terms. While her art is one of communication — through words and notes and human emotions — Taylor Swift should also be recognized as a masterful communicator in the digital age while off-stage.</p>

            <p>At its core, the field of communications is one of persuasion — whether one is selling an idea, a product or a service — and Taylor Swift does this like few others. Using the launch of her 10th original studio album Midnights as an exemplar, a playbook emerges with best practices for a successful launch.</p>

            <p>Though some paid promotions were activated in the countdown to the release of Midnights, Taylor Swift relied heavily on earned, shared and owned channels for her well-planned communications strategy.</p>

            <p>Given her status as a multiple Grammy Award–winner and global icon, without a well-planned launch campaign....</p>

            <p>While most brands don’t have an audience of the magnitude and level of devotion that Taylor Swift
                has, the example of her album Midnights does offer a roadmap for introducing new products into
                the market.</p>
            
            <p>This got us thinking…and so we turned to social listening tools, tracked mentions and sentiment
                against Taylor Swift’s multi-channel messaging.</p>

            <p>One thing became clear: Even when you are as beloved a superstar as Taylor Swift, a strategic and
                well-balanced communications campaign should still be part of every product launch.</p>
            <p>Behind every successful launch is a strategic plan. As she <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTozcxvFDtM">said
                    to Jimmy Fallon</a>, one of the
                things her fans tease her about is the meticulous “needing to plan things out.” She continued,
                “I think we’ve just stopped pretending it’s accidental at this point.”</p>

            <h2>Stories from the Data Mine</h2>
            <p>Monitoring news, Reddit, Tumblr, Twitter, YouTube and top blogs and forums suggest that the release of Taylor Swift’s Midnights album has been noteworthy for the artist, in terms of volume of mentions and in positive lift of her reputation.</p>

        <div class="container">
            <p>In the period following MTV’s 2022 Video Music Awards, when Taylor Swift first spoke of the
                Midnights launch date, she garnered 9,153,654 mentions, a 170% increase over the previous 58
                days (which saw just 3,387,464 mentions).</p>
            <p>And in the week for the on-sale date, the increase was even more dramatic: the number of mentions
                in social was up 216% over the previous 7 days with 3,263,797 mentions (making up 36% of that 9M
                volume). </p>
            <p>Looking at sentiment, the announcement and the album release pushed positive conversation up and
                the negative sentiment down; the number of positive mentions alone increased by 192%. Again,
                this becomes even more dramatic when looking at the week before the album release, when we see
                volumes of positive discussion increase 394% over the previous week.</p>
            <p>Both shifts can, in part, be explained by a pivot in conversation after Swift saw criticism over
                a late July report naming the singer as the biggest CO2 emitter of any celebrity. Following the
                VMA announcement, however, peaks in conversation were all attributable to anticipation for
                Midnights, fueled by the artist’s track name release (with particular excitement around the Lana
                Del Rey collaboration), and discussion around the American Music Awards.</p>
            <p>Though October 21, the day of the release, saw a slightly smaller peak than the initial
                announcement, it has resulted in more sustained levels of conversation, netting more than 2.2M
                mentions in three days, compared to the VMA announcement which netted 1.3M in three days.</p>

        <h2>A magnet for mentions</h2>
        <h3>08.28.22–10.28.22</h3>
        <p>The number of articles online that mentioned Taylor Swift in the seven-week lead-up to Midnights
            plus the seven days following is consistent with the level of user engagement. Her fan base is
            huge and wildly active on social channels—and authoritative media outlets with international
            reach and bloggers alike are game to cover the musical icon from whichever angle best suits
            their audiences.</p>
        <h3>Tracking the Album Tracks</h3>
        <p>From September 21 to October 23, we tracked mentions of specific song titles on blogs, forums,
            news, Reddit, Tumblr, Twitter and YouTube.</p>
        <p>The song “Anti-Hero” is by far the most talked-about song on social. This may be attributable to
            a number of factors, including the power and appeal of the song in and of itself, airplay,
            ranking on streaming services, airplay, and the #TSAntiHeroChallenge launched by Taylor Swift on
            YouTube Shorts on October 21. </p>

    <section class="block7">
        <div class="container">
            <p>The “3am Edition” tracks were generally less buzzed about than those on the original album, with
                the same holding true for the song “Hits Different” that was released as an exclusive to the CDs
                sold by Target.</p>
            <p>Social listening provided another layer of intelligence on consumer reception. Beginning a month
                prior to Midnights’ release, fans reacted enthusiastically to a series of Taylor Swift TikToks
                announcing track titles, #MidnightsMayhemWithMe. In comments, fans speculated on hidden meanings
                and easter eggs as merch, multiple versions of the album and concert dates were announced.</p>
            <p>Most fans were elated at the 3:00 a.m. announcement on October 21 of additional tracks, however
                some reacted less favorably, concerned that the album they had pre-ordered would not include the
                bonus tracks, meaning they might need to make additional purchases.</p>
            <p>On an October 24 Instagram post showing a Times Square ad of Pandora streaming Midnights,
                #TaylorNation expressed strong preferences for Spotify or Apple Music as their listening
                platform.</p>
            <p>After tour dates were officially announced, fans who endured long waits to book tickets and were
                unable to complete their purchases expressed frustration at the Ticketmaster fail or in some
                cases, prohibitively expensive ticket prices.</p>
            <p>Twitter over-indexed for positive sentiment. Positive posts with the highest engagement were
                clustered in October around the release of Midnights with @AppleMusic surveying fans about their
                favorite album to date and congratulating Taylor on the album release. Engagement for a post
                about Lana Del Rey’s collaboration on the album also contributed to the positivity of social
                chatter.</p>

            <h3>No Surprise with Midnights</h3>
            <p>As her previous two studio albums, evermore (December 11, 2020) and folklore (July 24, 2020), were surprise drops, and Swift has brought new fans into the fold in the time since they were introduced to the market, the story told by available data is one of significant organic social media growth in between releases.</p>
