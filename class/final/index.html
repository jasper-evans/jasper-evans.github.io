            <p><i>Has Washington DC become a city plagued with endemic illegal dumping? According to data
                    published by
                    the Washington DC City Government, during 2022, there were nearly 14,000 reported instances
                    of
                    illegal dumping submitted to the City’s 311, a service used to organize and respond to
                    non-emergency
                    incidents requiring municipal service assistance. While this number looms, some DC Wards saw
                    far
                    less illegal dumping compared to others.</i></p>

                    <p>According to the US Office of Disease prevention and Health Promotion, exposure to environmental
                        pollutants have the potential to spur respiratory diseases, heart disease, and some forms of
                        cancer.
                        This agency notes, individuals with low incomes are more likely to live in areas suffering from
                        environmental pollution and are more likely to feel health effects from increased exposure to
                        pollutants.</p>
                    <p>311 report data compiled by the DC city government revealed, during 2022, the top 3 DC city Wards
                        with the highest reports of illegal dumping were Ward 7 (2,250) reports, Ward 1 (2,315) reports,
                        and
                        Ward 5 (3,080) reports. Ward 3 was attributed to, by far, the least number of reports of illegal
                        dumping at 402 reports during the year 2022. Ward 2 totaled the next lowest total of reports at
                        1062.</p>
                    <p>Thousands of reports separate the top 3 Wards from the highest number of illegal dumping reports
                        in Ward 3, the Ward with the least number of illegal dumping 311 reports in 2022.</p>

                <p>According to data from the US Census Bureau’s 2017-2021 American Community Survey, Washington DC’s
                    Ward 3 stands apart from Wards 7, 1, and 5 quite starkly. Ward 3 has the highest median household
                    income of all DC Wards, has the third lowest total population, and has the highest percentage of
                    white residents of all DC Wards, at approximately 69%. According to the DC City Government, Ward 3
                    is largely residential, and consists of single-family homes of modest size and “mansion”
                    proportions; Ward 3 holds the highest number of cul-de-sacs than any other Ward in the city –
                    effectively reducing vehicle traffic to a few corridors of travel . Ward 3 is additionally home to a
                    high number of DC’s foreign embassies, current and former high-ranking government officials, and
                    public figures.</p>
                </div>
                <p>Ward 1 ranked second among all dc Wards in reported cases of illegal dumping to the 311 service.
                    DC’s
                    Ward 1 has the second lowest total population, ahead of Ward 6. Ward 1’s median household income
                    according to the US census bureau is approximately $111,575, nearly $27,000 more than the median
                    household income of Ward 5, the DC Ward with the highest number of illegal dumping 311 reports
                    in
                    2022. In contrast to Ward 3, Ward 1 is among Washington DC’s most ethnically diverse Wards
                    according
                    to Census ACS data, with more than 50 percent of residents reporting being of non-white
                    background,
                    and approximately 42% of residents reporting to be of white background. Mapping the coordinates of 311 reports of
                    illegal
                    dumping, the phusical concentration of reported dumping incidents appeared to be the highest in ward 1, the highest of all
                     Wards noted in this article. This concentration of reports in Ward 1 appears ot be amplifoed mainly due to Ward 1 being the, geographically, smallest Ward in the city.</p>

                <p>Wards 7 and 5 are quite different to Wards 3 and 1 on many levels. Wards 7 and 5 are
                    demographically,
                    predominantly black, have the two highest total populations of all DC Wards, and both have
                    median
                    household incomes below the overall median household income of Washington DC, which is $93,547.
                    A
                    similar mapping effort conducted for Ward 7 and 5 reports showed both, noticeable concentrations
                    of
                    dumping incidents, and an, overall, evenly distributed pattern of dumping activity.</p>
                <p>Wards 7 and 5 house a majority of the city’s total population and experience a majority of the
                    city’s
                    illegal dumping. Both Ward 5 and 7 saw a combined total of nearly 600 reported instances of
                    illegal
                    dumping in March 2022, alone. These report totals began to trend downward toward the end of the
                    year, however remained higher than Wards 1 and 3, combined.</p>

                <p>311 reports may not tell the whole story of the environmental strife Wards 7 and 5 have faced;
                    however, 311 reports should be leveraged as an indicator of an issue that deserves a resolution.
                    Individuals of low income are more likely to live in areas which face increased environmental
                    pollution that may aggravate underlying health conditions and may have long-term health
                    implications. Long term illness amongst a population already living under the city’s median income
                    has the potential to deepen systemic inequities and income disparities in Washington DC. 311 reports
                    only scratch the surface of what other cases of environmental pollution may be affecting the
                    communities of Wards 5 and 7. As most of DC’s population resides in Wards 5 and 7, the DC city
                    government should examine the observed issue and strive to address inequities affecting the public
                    health of the residents of its most populous Wards.</p>
