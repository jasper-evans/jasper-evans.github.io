    <P>Are you a red sauce or white sauce sort of person? Or does it vary depending on your mood?  A good cheesy Alfredo is a reliable pasta sauce whenever I’m craving a familiar comfort. The mascarpone cheese helps create a sauce that is slightly sweet and oh-so-gooey.</P>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces fettuccine</li>
        <li>3 cups chopped broccoli florets</li>
        <li>8 ounces boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Italian blend cheese</li>
        <li>4 ounces mascarpone cheese, room temperature</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F. Lightly coat a 9 x 13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the fettuccine and cook until almost al dente. Add the broccoli and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, until the pasta is al dente and the broccoli is crisp-tender. Drain and return to the pot.</li>
        <br>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, season the chicken with salt and pepper. In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat, add the chicken, and sauté until fully cooked. Add the chicken to the pasta/ broccoli mixture.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat, add the garlic, and cook for 30 seconds, being careful not to burn it. Whisk in the ﬂour to form a roux. Cook for 30 seconds, then whisk in the milk and cheeses and continue whisking until the sauce thickens, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Pour the sauce over the pasta, broccoli, and chicken and stir to combine. Pour the mixture into the baking dish.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Bake for 15 to 20 minutes until golden brown and bubbling. Let cool for 10 minutes and serve.</li>
